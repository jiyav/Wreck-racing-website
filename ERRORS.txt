Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
- declared paths based on vscode path extension for .js files, and follow regular/expected paths in html files
- converted all module js files to .mjs extension


in order for typer.js library to fire each time a navigation button is clicked, we must reload the
html file/scripts. had to get rid of the preventDefault() method in the router. I think this is a 
blanket fix for now, i'll figure out later how to maintain the SPA framework using this effect. 

so as of now we are no longer really an SPA due to the page reloads!
