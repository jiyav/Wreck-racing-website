            <p class="mission-description">Wreck Racing is an all-student racing team that 
              builds cars for the 
              <a href="https://www.grassrootsmotorsports.com/" target="_blank">Grassroots Motorsports $2000 Challenge</a>. 
              With a tight budget, the 
              $2000 Challenge favors those with more ingenuity and skill than 
              money. As many as 100 different teams return each year to battle 
              it out and see who can squeeze the most performance from a penny. 
              Our current Challenge build features a Factory Five 818 with a 
              K-series Honda engine, and a Nissan 300zx body.

        <p class="three-types-of-people">There are typically three types of people who will join Wreck Racing:</p>
        <div class="container-holder">
          
          <div class="container-child">
            <div class="numberCircle">1</div>
            <h2>Newbies</h2>
            <p>These are people who know very little about cars, but would like to know more. 
              Whether it be driving, fixing, breaking, tuning, or even general maintenance these 
              people are in the club to learn as much as they can about cars and engineering. Nowhere 
              else at Georgia Tech can you find a club that will provide you with more hands-on 
              experience with real cars. This allows students to finally put their classroom theory 
              into real-life situations.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="container-child">
            <div class="numberCircle">2</div>
            <h2>Car enthusiast</h2>
            <p>These people are generally experienced gearheads. They know a lot about cars and 
              can tell you anything about cars ranging from normal maintenance to high-performance 
              modifications. More than likely, these people drive a fast car (or more than one of them!)
               and are pretty good at it! They typically join the club because we can offer them one of 
               the most unique and challenging automotive experiences they will ever have.

            <h2>Car freaks</h2>
            <p>The final type of person usually owns at least two cars 
              (neither of which was purchased for more than $500) and has performed at 
              least one engine swap on both of them. These guys are total car freaks. When 
              they are not trying to piece together a Wreck Racing car, you can probably find 
              them in their own garage trying to piece together their own. Wreck Racing offers 
              these people their car fix while stuck at school.</p>
