    <div class="about">
        <div class="who">
            <h1>Who?</h1>
            <p>Wreck Racing is an all-student racing team that builds cars for the Grassroots Motorsports $2000 Challenge. If you're interested in learning about how cars work and want some hands-on experience by actually working on one, make sure to swing by one of our info sessions and join the slack! We welcome new members from all majors and years, and absolutely no prior experience is necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="what">
            <h1>What?</h1>
            <p>Our club activities include weekly (even daily for some members) worknights at the stop, semesterly auto-crosses (where you will have a chance to learn manual and race your own car), as well as the yearly Grassroots competition. There are also several opportunities to network with our sponsors/companies such as Tesla, Rivian, etc who regularly come visit.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="when">
            <h1>When?</h1>
            <p>Worknights are 7-9pm Tuesdays and Thursdays. Other major club events will always be posted in the slack. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="where">
            <h1>Where?</h1>
            <p>The workshop is located at the Student Competition Center (SCC). It is within walking distance of west campus, though most people offer/request rides in the slack or take the green bus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>The main point of Wreck Racing is to give students an opportunity to learn new skills in regards to engineering, car mechanics, teamwork, and problem-solving. And of course to have fun, meet new people, and overall elevate your college experience. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="how">
            <h1>How?</h1>
            <p>At Wreck Racing, you get out of it whatever you put in. The weekly commitment is flexible, and you have the freedom to switch subteams/projects if you decide something else may be a better fit or more of interest to you. </p>
